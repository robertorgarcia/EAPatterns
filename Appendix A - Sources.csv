It was predicted that self-theories would correlate with perceived locus of control, in the direction that the more external an individual is the more they believe in entity theory. It was also predicted that political orientation would correlate with self-theories in the direction of the more conservative an individual is, the more they support entity theory. Finally it was predicted that political orientation would correlate with PLOC in the direction of the more internal an individual is, the more conservative they are. Some 259 subjects were recruited from undergraduate psychology courses at the University of Maine. They were administered Rotter's PLOC Scale, the Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale, the Zappala Political Orientation Scale, and demographic questions. A low but statistically significant correlation was found between PLOC and incremental and entity self-theories, r (258) = .20, p = .002. Also a low but statistically significant relationships were found between political orientation and self-theories, r = -.13, p = .040, and political orientation and PLOC, r (258) = .14, p = .032.

In this paper, we focus on business process support analysis using information derived from enterprise architecture description. We give a systematic overview of important aspects. We establish and formally define foundational enterprise architecture patterns for business process support analysis. They are implementation independent and enable more efficient qualitative architecture analysis of business process support, which is the basis for achieving more optimal business operation. We have defined the patterns using the standard enterprise architecture language - ArchiMate. They are formalized in a way that enables their implementation in enterprise architecture tools. This is an important characteristic that allows for efficient work by automatic detection of different, more or less suitable, architecture structures. We have derived the patterns based on real-world enterprise architecture descriptions and have used and verified them in enterprise architecture analysis and planning projects for four large organizations.

Recruitment patterns can help analysts to tackle repetitive and piecemeal recruitment problems. However, they have been criticized for being applied in isolation and not easy to integrate. Therefore, enterprise recruitment pattern is recommended when building recruitment systems. When defining such pattern, support from enterprise recruitment architectures (ERAs) is needed to facilitate the reuse of that pattern in different recruitment development processes. For this reason, we present a problem-oriented conceptual model developed by the authors with the purpose of addressing the key architectural elements of the recruitment system, as well as their interdependence, in a high level of abstraction. The essence of the model is that when such architectural elements and their relationships are combined in a coherent manner, enterprise recruitment patterns can be formed based on this. The pattern here is defined by using a template where its elements correspond to the elements of the ERA depicted in the conceptual model.

The set of elements was obtained by theoretical analysis of information systems and business process definitions and enterprise architectures. The patterns were evolved from a number of information systems theories and tested in 48 information systems change management projects.

A review of these frameworks shows that some models are frequently discussed, some are framework specific, and some use a different wording to refer to similar CEBMs, pointing to the need to consolidate the current state of the art. We conduct a morphological analysis of 26 current CEBMs from the literature, which includes defining their major business model dimensions and identifying the specific characteristics of these dimensions. Based on this analysis, we identify a broad range of business model design options and propose six major CEBM patterns with the potential to support the closing of resource flows: repair and maintenance; reuse and redistribution; refurbishment and remanufacturing; recycling; cascading and repurposing; and organic feedstock business model patterns.

Therefore, the rich body of literature on business model patterns has not yet reached its full potential for both practical application as well as theoretic advancement. To help remedy this, we conduct an exhaustive review, filter for duplicates, and structure the patterns along several dimensions by applying a rigorous taxonomy-building approach.

Building on this premise, we offer a synthesis and consolidation of the available knowledge about SBMs. Following the notion of patterns as problem–solution combinations, we developed, tested, and applied a new multi-method and multi-step approach centred on an expert review process that combines literature review, Delphi survey, and physical card sorting to identify and validate the currently existing SBM patterns. Ten international experts participated in this process. They classified 45 SBM patterns, assigned these patterns to 11 groups along ecological, social, and economic dimensions of sustainability and evaluated their potential to contribute to value creation.

The design of the latter is critical, since it will influence the overall quality of IT services. However, designing IT infrastructures for large organizations is a challenge task since it requires knowledge of existing organization processes, the views of different players, and the conjunction of technical expertise in different domains, that rarely reside in a single individual. To improve the design of IT infrastructures, namely by allowing to reuse proven solutions to recurrent problems we propose the use of IT infrastructure patterns. The use of patterns in the design of IT infrastructure will provide several benefits such as facilitate the communication among IT design stakeholders, simplify the whole design process and potentially decrease size and complexity, which all contribute to increase the quality of IT service management processes. This paper present the preliminary effort to build supplier-independent IT infrastructure patterns and we introduce two of them, covering aspects from its rationale to instantiation that will hopefully leverage the IT infrastructure design process and create a positive impact in the quality of IT service management processes trough proven and better designed IT infrastructures. © 2010 IEEE.",2010-10,21/10/2019 17:22,21/10/2019 17:22,,171–176,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,,,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\Silvana\Downloads\05655264.pdf,,Information technology; Design patterns; IT infrastructure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11,No Method,IT service management,Non-standard modeling language and written description,None presented in this article,Describes 2 patterns and hints at a technical report I wasn't able to find so far,6,"Da Silva, L.

This completely rewritten version of the best selling Architecture and Patterns for IT Service Management, Resource Planning and Governance retains the original (and still unique) approach: apply the discipline of enterprise architecture to the business of large scale IT management itself. Author Charles Betz applies his deep practitioner experience to a critical reading of ITIL version 3, COBIT version 4, the CMMI suite, the IT portfolio management literature, and the Agile/Lean IT convergence, and derives a value stream analysis, IT semantic model, and enabling systems architecture (covering current topics such as CMDB/CMS, Service Catalog, and IT Portfolio Management). The edition pioneers new ground in applying dynamic modeling (systems dynamics) to large scale IT process interactions, and the fundamental discipline of traceable process, data, and system analysis which made the 1st edition so popular remain. This best seller is a must read for anyone charged with enterprise architecture, IT planning, and IT governance and management. Presents a field-tested, detailed conceptual information model with definitions and usage scenarios, mapped to both the process and system architectures Updated to reflect the new set of concepts, practices, and procedures of ITIL v3.1 Synthesizes Enterprise Architecture, IT Service Management, and IT Governance in a practical way.

As a basic characteristic, disruptive technologies lead to a severe shift in value-creation networks giving rise to new market segments. One of the key challenges is to anticipate the business logics within these nascent and formerly unknown markets. Business model patterns promise to tackle this challenge. They can be interpreted as proven business model elements, which reveal valuable insights about pursued business logics. The approach in general helps increasing efficiency in business models design processes, but especially lacks methodological support so far. The paper at hand, therefore presents a methodology for pattern-based business model design simplifying development and analysis of business models for disruptive technologies.

Since then, research has formalized recurring configurations as digital business model types, still frequently being used to analyze existing business models and develop new ones. Now, the next wave of digital transformation - enabled by ongoing improvements in processing power, the miniaturization of hardware, and ubiquitous wireless connectivity - is again driving innovation. For instance, in the mobility sector, startups such as Uber, Turo, and Streetline have formed business logics that cannot be understood with existing types. Therefore, we identified and formalized new business model configurations by systematically analyzing a comprehensive data set of technology startups from the US mobility sector. We found that, in order to adequately account for the new digital logics, 14 digital business model types must be added to existing collections: app developer, autonomous products/robots manufacturer, data analytics provider, integrator of thirdparty services, IT-enabled self-service provider, IT-guided service provider, manufacturer of connected physical products, manufacturer of connectivity devices for physical products, mobilized service provider, P2P goods sharing platform, P2P information sharing community, P2P service provision platform, seller of sensor information, and sensor-enabled service innovator.",2016,21/10/2019 17:21,21/10/2019 17:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\Silvana\Downloads\7ea1bd4217dbb3b1b2a815e2406fafd4816b.pdf,,Crunchbase; Digital business model types; E-business model types; Mobility sector; Startups,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,Market research,Business Model Innovation,Business model coded as Weil et al. 2005 and descriptive,none,Describes 27 digital business model types,27,"Remane, G., Hildebrandt, B., Hanelt, A., & Kolbe, L.
